Problem Scenarios
The application should include the following features:

1. A form with labeled text fields to enter the following student details:
  o Name
  o Roll Number
  o Father’s Name
  o Caste
  o District
  o GPA
2. Buttons for the following actions:
  o Add: Adds a new student record to the text file.
  o Update: Modifies an existing student record.
  o Delete: Removes a student record from the file.
  o Next: Navigates through the records stored in the file.

3. User Interaction Scenarios:
  o When the application starts:
   The Update and Delete buttons are disabled.
   The Add button is enabled to allow adding the first record.
  o Clicking the Add button will save the entered details in the text file
  and display a confirmation message.
  o Clicking the Next button will display the next student’s record in
  the text fields.  
   The Add button will be disabled during this mode, and
  Update and Delete buttons will be enabled.
  o The Update button will modify the currently displayed student’s
  record using the Roll Number as a unique identifier.
  o The Delete button will remove the currently displayed student’s
record from the file.
You are expected to implement the above scenarios and design the GUI to be
user-friendly.
